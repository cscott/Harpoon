This directory contains C source files for the FLEX runtime.

See the file REQUIRED for the tools required to build it.
After installing the tools, you'll want to run ./setup
to let autoheader/autoconf/automake do their thing.
See the INSTALL file for generic build instructions;
the BUILDING file has more specific information.

This package contains runtime-support classes for any FLEX
optimizations/transformations which need them.
<i>Single-class</i> support code should go in this package;
if your support code comprises several classes, it should
get its own package under this one, ideally named after the
analysis/transformation which requires it: see for example,
<code>harpoon.Analysis.LowQuad.Transactions</code> and
<code>harpoon.Runtime.Transactions</code>.
<p>
For large amounts of support code with specific dependencies that do
not mesh well with the FLEX build infrastructure, considering adding
a <code>JAR</code> file to <code>Support/</code> with the pre-built
support code, and creating a separate CVS module for the actual
sources.

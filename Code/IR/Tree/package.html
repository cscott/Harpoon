<BODY>
An expression-tree oriented low-level IR, intended to facilitate
machine-specific pattern-matching code-generation.  <code>Tree</code>
form is our "portable assembly language"; a loosely-typed
non-register-allocated fine-grain representation that exposes all the
details of object representation, method invocation, and runtime
interfacing, which can easily be translated to the machine-specific
<code>Instr</code>s of <code>harpoon.IR.Assem</code> for register
allocation and scheduling before output.
<p>
The details of run-time organization and datatype representation are
abstracted away by the machine-specific <code>Frame</code>, conforming
to the interface in <code>harpoon.Backend.Generic.Frame</code>.
Frames are not entirely machine-specific; all machines with roughly
the same datatypes (for example, 32-bit words) which use the same
runtime implementation will be able to share large parts of a Frame
implementation.
See <code>harpoon.Backend.Generic.Frame</code> for more details.

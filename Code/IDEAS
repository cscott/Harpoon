Research ideas:
 - live variable analysis?  only add phi/sigma if variable is live in/out.
 - automatic partitioning for dsps... Given DSP algorithm, DSP core,
      take part of the algorithm and make a hardware coprocessor
      out of it, integrating with the semi-custom DSP.
 - java car... use single unified language for uC programming and
               simple fpga hdl for vision processing or somesuch.

 - write once, run anywhere on hardware?
 - interesting hardware backends:
    -- synchronous:
       fpgas
       standard cell
    -- asynchronous:
       four-phase, two-phase, one-phase
       superconducting logic, based on josephson junctions.
    -- RAW??
    REFERENCES!
 - type analysis interesting in itself?
 - bitwidth analysis to construct specialized dsp/processor cores?
   (low energy/power, code density, etc)

 - handle exceptions as java-to-java translation.

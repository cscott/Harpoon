Provides the classes for performing Data-Flow Analysis on a number of
Intermediate Representations.

<blockquote>The purpose of data-flow analysis is to provide global information
about how a procedure (or a larger segment of a program) manipulates
its data.  For example, constant-propagation analysis seeks to
determine whether all asssignments to a particular variable that may
provide the value of that variable at some particular point
necessarily give it the same constant value.  If so, a use of the
variable at that point can be replaced by the constant.

<P>
The design of the DataFlow package implements data-flow analysis
passes in terms of three parts: a flowgraph of nodes, a node-visitor
to calculate flow functions defined according to a lattice, and a
solver to find a maximum fixed point of the lattice.

<P>
Generally the nodes of an analysis will be BasicBlock objects, and the
corresponding visitor will be an subclass of BasicBlockVisitor.

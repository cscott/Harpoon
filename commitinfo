# The "commitinfo" file is used to control pre-commit checks.
# The filter on the right is invoked with the repository and a list 
# of files to check.  A non-zero exit of the filter program will 
# cause the commit to be aborted.
#
# The first entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
# against the directory that the change is being committed to, relative
# to the $CVSROOT.  For the first match that is found, then the remainder
# of the line is the name of the filter to run.
#
# If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions in this
# file, the "DEFAULT" line is used, if it is specified.
#
# If the name "ALL" appears as a regular expression it is always used
# in addition to the first matching regex or "DEFAULT".

# NOTE:  contrib/commit_prep usage:
# -r    - record directories affected by commit for use with contrib/log_accum
# -u    - keep track of diff of all changes (for contrib/log_accum)
# -c    - check for things like "$Id" near head of file, no "$Log", etc.

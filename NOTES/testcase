Test case is a java chip: a processor that executes java byte code.
package silicon.JavaChip.
throw Exceptions for javachip code exceptions (catch & handle)
use arrays for register file, stack, etc.
(so all the compiler features are used)
32-bit machine.
At boot load special-purpose registers with start/end of stack,heap,system
 class area, and check dynamically during execution.
 -- maybe use 16 bits for these registers?
    (tests bitwidth analysis bigtime)
unsigned int (address) as cast to long and & 0xFFFFFFFF. bitwidth anal again.
alternatively, split stack/class/heap data areas to increase memory BW,
  with special instructions to transfer data between these.
special byte codes?  special methods?

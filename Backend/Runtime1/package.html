<code>Runtime1</code> is the first implementation of a FLEX backend
runtime system.  It uses static layout of class and interface methods
for fast invocation, and a 'class display' structure for fast
instanceof tests.  It includes information to support JNI native methods.
It supports a variety of different memory allocation strategies.

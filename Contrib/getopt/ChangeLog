For release 1.0

No changes.  Just increment release number to 1.0

For release 0.9.2

The sample code has been moved into a separate file called "GetoptDemo.java".
This is so that it can be legally placed into the public domain and not
subsumed into the LGPL as would be the case if it were in Getopt.java.
While I do not encourage anyone to write proprietary software, I feel that
there is no good purpose served in restricting what someone can do with
a short example program.

Modified the Makefile and various other files to support the change
above.

For release 0.9.1

This release contains only minor fixes.  It's always possible it introduces
some bugs though so unless you are keen on internationalization or are
having a line separator problem, there is no need to upgrade from 0.9.

-- Messages are now internationalized.  Thanks to Bill King 
   (wrking@eng.sun.com) for this.

-- Changes all print's to println's to avoid system dependent line
   separators.

-- All internal variables are now protected.  Several people suggested
   doing this in response to my request for comments in the help file.
   No one suggested keeping any variables public.

-- Fixed parts of licensing that mentioned the regular GPL.  Getopt is
   and always has been licensed under the LPGL.  Thanks to Arieh Markel 
   (arieh.markel@sun.com) for pointing this out.

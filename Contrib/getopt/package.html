This is a Java port of the GNU getopt functions for command-line parsing.
I have attempted to keep the functionality 
and programmer's interface as faithful to the original as possible.
However, due to differences between Java and C, some minor changes
has to me made.  (Given the obtuse interface in the clib version, 
perhaps some major changes should have been made).  This should not 
affect the way options appear to be parsed to the end user of program 
that uses this Java getopt.  The use of these classes are completely 
documented in the javadoc comments, so I will not repeat that info here. 
</p><p>
Note that since these objects are part of a package called "gnu.getopt", 
they need to be in a subdirectory called gnu/getopt somewhere in your 
CLASSPATH.  This includes the file called MessagesBundle.properties.

I am not aware of any bugs.  If you find one though, please send email 
to me at arenn@urbanophile.com.  The more detailed a bug report the better. 
Bug fixes are also welcome at the same address.  Please reference
release number "1.0".  If you use this code, it would be helpful
if you let me know so that I can let you know if anything changes or
if any major bugs have been found/fixed.

There is sample code showing how to use getopt available in the
GetoptDemo.java file.
